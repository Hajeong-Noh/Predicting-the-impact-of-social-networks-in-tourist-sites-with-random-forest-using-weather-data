# Proyect Web Science


First, I have to clarify that this repository is a  reference for myself. Consequently, the cleaness is not the best (sadly). 

The project consisted in predicting the use of social networks on specific places of interest of a turistic city (Como, Italy) using the weather information. 

Due to the characteristics of the problem, we can divide the problem in two:
  - Get the data from a Social Network (instagram)
  - Creating a predictor

Useful things to do with this code:
  - Scrapping info from Instagram daily likes, or photos for example in especific locations without getting banned imitating the queries of instagram.
  - Creating a predictor in base of a variable that has a growing rate using random forest without getting in Series of Time with some decents apprx. and standarizations. 


 Basic explanations of the files
- Places of Como.xlsx is a hand made file using as a reference the most popular places of the city in accordance with TripAdvisor.
- FinalDatabase....xlsx is the final database cleaned (be carreful with the time zones please) I put the according to the place but I had problems with excel + R dates.
- Notes of R.Rmd is a markdown barely self explanatory about the steps that I followes to get to the results.


Achivements:
- Not being banned by Instagram, prooving that is a web site where I can get data for another projects.
- No over complex model that has 90% of acc.
